#+title: IRF-augmented MKKS model
#+bibliography: ~/Org/zoter_refs.bib

* Overview

This fork implements State-depended IRF as described by [cite/t:@amendola_2024_linear].
Also implements a few refinementes, such as:

-

* Breaking changes

- git is not tracking some file extension that are either machine-specific (such as *.o) or that bloats the .git folder
- The initialization is not-longer waiting for number_banks > 1
  - This is done in MKKS-2.0

* Technical changes

- Alphaleia outmatically handles with code identantion, this might flag some changes in git that are not relevant changes
- The inclusion of the INTERNALS macro is harmless to the code
  - In essence, it does nothing. However, this declaration is enough to trigger autocompetion for LSD macros in a few text editors

* Desired, but not planned changes

- Reduce the number of Searches (performance)
- Reduce the number of cycles (performance)
- Create SFC check at initialization
- Use NO_SEARCH flag (performance)
- Update code with new macros
