* Overview

This fork implements State-depended IRF as described by [cite/t:@amendola_2024_linear].
Also implements a few refinementes, such as:

-

* Breaking changes

- git is not tracking some file extension that are either machine-specific (such as *.o) or that bloats the .git folder

* Technical changes

- Alphaleia outmatically handles with code identantion, this might flag some changes in git that are not relevant changes
- The inclusion of the INTERNALS macro is harmless to the code
  - In essence, it does nothing. However, this declaration is enough to trigger autocompetion for LSD macros in a few text editors
